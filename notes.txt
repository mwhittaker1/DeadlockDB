The Matches. 13,000

12 players for each match in matches, player_matches, 1 row per player
For each distinct player in player_matches, create player trends and stats -> match_histories.

player_match_history:#### Work In Progress! ###
raw_player_match_data and raw_match_info data were downloaded, cleaned, and inserted into the raw_data db.

Next step 5/12 5pm:
For each distinct account_id in match_players
get match_info_history and filtered_player_matches where match_id == match_id and,
add to player_matches_history

Ensure rolling stats are being caluclated.

Create logic for 'recency' in a way that allows bulk matches to be trained on.

Train model

refactor players_to_trend_from_db function.


RAW_DATA DB Structure
matches_for_training = Duplicate of deadlock.db matches
staging_cleaned = filtered set of columns from match_players raw data
filtered_player_matches = staging_cleaned filtered by distinct account_id from matches_for_training
match_info_history = raw match_info bulk data
high_quality_matches = filtered match_info for matches with skill level greater than badge # 75

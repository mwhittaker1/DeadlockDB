Train model


MAIN DB STRUCTURE
matches = Recent high level matches to be predicted.
player_matches = all players in matches. These players need trends, streaks, and statistics.
player_matches_history = for each player in player_matches, all historical matches those players played in.
player_trends = for each player in player_matches, calculated statistics and streaks
player_rolling_stats = 

RAW_DATA DB Structure
matches_for_training = Duplicate of deadlock.db matches
dup_player_matches = duplicate of deadlock.db player_matches
staging_cleaned = formatted raw_player_match_data 
filtered_player_matches = match history for each distinct player in matches_for_training

match_info_history = raw match_info bulk data
high_quality_matches = filtered match_info for matches with skill level greater than badge # 75

The Matches. 13,000

12 players for each match in matches, player_matches, 1 row per player
For each distinct player in player_matches, create player trends and stats -> match_histories.

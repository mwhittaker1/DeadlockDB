MAIN DB STRUCTURE
matches = Recent high level matches to be predicted.
player_matches = all players in matches. These players need trends, streaks, and statistics.
player_matches_history = for each player in player_matches, all historical matches those players played in.
player_trends = for each player in player_matches, calculated statistics and streaks
player_rolling_stats = 

RAW_DATA DB Structure
matches_for_training = Duplicate of deadlock.db matches
dup_player_matches = duplicate of deadlock.db player_matches
staging_cleaned = formatted raw_player_match_data 
filtered_player_matches = match history for each distinct player in matches_for_training

match_info_history = raw match_info bulk data
high_quality_matches = filtered match_info for matches with skill level greater than badge # 75

The Matches. 13,000

12 players for each match in matches, player_matches, 1 row per player
For each distinct player in player_matches, create player trends and stats -> match_histories.

1. Correlation Heatmap

Visualize the correlation between all features
Identify which features are highly correlated with the target variable (match outcome)
Detect multicollinearity between features that might be redundant

2. Win Rate Distribution Plots

Compare distributions of p_win_rate for winning vs. losing teams
Show density plots of team average win rates to see if they predict match outcomes
Visualize the relationship between win rates and actual match results

3. Streak Analysis

Bar charts comparing win/loss streaks between winning and losing teams
Box plots of p_win_streak_avg and p_loss_streak_avg grouped by match outcome
Histograms showing how different streak lengths (2-5) correlate with match results

4. Rolling Performance Visualization

Line plots showing how p_win_pct_2-5 values correlate with match outcomes
Scatter plots of team average rolling stats vs. win probability
Visualize how the recency of performance affects prediction accuracy

5. Player vs. Hero Performance

Scatter plots of p_v_h_kd_pct against match outcomes
Box plots comparing p_avg_kd relative to hero averages between winning/losing teams
Histograms of p_v_h_pick_rate to identify comfort picks' impact on outcomes

6. Feature Importance from Random Forest

Bar chart of feature importance scores from a preliminary random forest model
Show which features contribute most to prediction accuracy
Compare importance across different model configurations

7. Team Composition Analysis

Stacked bar charts showing hero pick rates in winning vs. losing teams
Visualize the relationship between team's collective hero expertise and outcomes
Show how player high-pick-rate heroes have higher win trends

8. Aggregated Team Metrics

Scatter plots comparing team aggregates (avg KD ratio, avg win rate)
Box plots showing the difference in team aggregates between winning and losing teams
Visualize if imbalance in team metrics predicts outcome

9. Experience vs. Performance

Scatter plots of p_total_matches against win rate to see experience's impact
Visualize if players with more experience but lower recent performance outperform the opposite
Show how team experience distribution relates to match outcomes

10. KD Ratio Impact

Violin plots of p_avg_kd for winning vs. losing teams
Compare the distribution of KD ratios across different hero types
Visualize the relationship between KD ratio variance within a team and match outcomes

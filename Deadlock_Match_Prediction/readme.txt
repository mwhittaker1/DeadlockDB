I should put something here

this will be a match prediction program for the game Deadlock.

I hope to use k-means clustering for player types, pre-trianing and fine tune training to create the model

Final stages should be 'paper-esque' with graphs detailing decisions made from data analytics performed as well as a public facing prediction model.

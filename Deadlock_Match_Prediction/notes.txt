###issue - in "dl_process_data.win_loss_history" current logic for 3/5_pct functions counts 0 as 1 to avoid division error, however this creates 100% and skews logic.

###Working on build_training_data
## need to append each iterations, currently overwrites.

#### For a match  ####
## for each player ##
# use p_match_history as primary DataFrame
# merge match_metadata for team win

# fetch player last 3 matches W/l player_last_3_w_%
# fetch player last 30 days W/l player_last_30_w_%

### filter to player_hero
# fetch player_hero last 3 matches W/l & pickrate
# fetch player_hero last 30 days W/l_team & pickrate

### fetch hero_stats for all heroes
# hero last 7 days w/l trend & pickrate
# hero last 30 days w/l trend & pickrate

#### loop for each player, save hero_stats for each player ####

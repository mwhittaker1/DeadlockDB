get_players_from_matches, each fetch is a dataframe,
turning them into a list of dataframes. needs fixing.

need to create 7d and 30d trends for many data points:
player_win
p_hero_win


## Need to dig deep into sql window function vs match_history_outcome_add

Approach:

1: confirm process:
 a: collect bulk matches and store/save (base_matches)
 b: pull match players from matches (match_players)
 c: get match_history for all players (p_match_history)
    i: calculate_player_stats
    ii: calculate_player_hero_stats
 d: get hero_trends
 e: get player_match_history_stat (win_pct)
 f: combine into single DF
 g: normalize
 h: build player scores
 i: build team scores
 j: train model, seperate test data
 k: test model
 l: fine tune if needed
 m: prod.
